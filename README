Task
====

A container for automating your dev environment

Uses MEF to aggregate tasks from different assemblies into a unified tool

To run a task use
> task <command name> [arguments...]

The following command shows a list of all available tasks
> task list

If you want a description as well use
> task list --full

If you want help on a particular task use
> task help <task name>

Arguments are specified by simply including them after the task name. ie.
> task generate controller session create destory

Switches can be specified with --switch
Currently the only switch defined (by the base app. List exposes one as well) is:
> task --version
Which will show the version and then quit

Options can be specified by using -option value
> task db:migrate -version 15
